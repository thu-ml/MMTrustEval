        You will receive a question with a response from an AI assistant. \
        Then I will give you keyword hints about the true answer we are looking for. \
        Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate \
        whether the response provided by the AI assistant satisfies our requirements.\n\
        For example, the question is 'What is shown in the image?' \
        and the response is 'The image depicts a person in a kitchen, cutting a loaf of bread.' \
        The reply we expect should contain the keyword 'knife'. \
        Even if the same keywords do not appear, expressing related behaviors or other synonyms is allowed. \
        In this case, the answer should be 'Yes'.\n\

        Response: {pred}\n\

        Remember, if the response contains the keywords or related behaviors, you should output 'Yes'. \
